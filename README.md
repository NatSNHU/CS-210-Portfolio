# CS-210-Portfolio

This project was written to help a corner grocery store keep inventory of its sold items from produce, and outputs a .dat file for records. C++ is a bit strange with separate class files, but this project helped create an understanding of header files which will help me with any c++ projects going forward. I feel like there is always room for improvement in terms of efficiency and would like to improve how effectively my code runs. During the course I did learn about memory leaks and garbage collection, this was something I was loosely aware of but never took the time to learn. The most difficult code to write was the classes. I had a difficult time moving between files with different inclusions and namespaces, though I did accomplish the task in the end I do still need to practice more in that area. Though there were some changes, most if not all code follows a certain blueprint of logic that is transferable between languages. At the end of this course I now feel more confident jumping between those languages.
